# 📊 SQL Data Warehouse Project

## Overview
This project showcases the design and implementation of a **modern data warehouse using SQL Server**, covering data ingestion, ETL processes, data modeling, and analytical querying.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **data engineering and analytics best practices** through a hands-on, end-to-end implementation suitable for portfolio purposes.
